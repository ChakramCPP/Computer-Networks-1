Task: TCP Socket Programming

Write a TCP server program: which passively listens for an incoming TCP connection
1. Write a TCP client program: which actively opens a TCP connection to the server;
the server's IP address should be taken as a commandline parameter
2. On connection establishment, the server should print the IPaddress and port of the
client's end of the TCP connection
3. After connection establishment, the server application should send 1500 bytes
periodically, every SEND_INTERVAL milliseconds
 What this means is: if the time since the previous send is lesser than
SEND_INTERVAL, then make the process sleep (using usleep) for the
appropriate amount of time.
4. After connection establishment, the client application should receive 1500 bytes
periodically, every RECEIVE_INTERVAL milliseconds
 What this means is: if the time since the previous receive is lesser than
RECEIVE_INTERVAL, then make the process sleep for the appropriate
amount of time
5. In the server and client programs, use appropriate fprintf(stderr) or “cerr” statements
to illustrate how flow control happens; show this as the demo.
Additional interest: run the above server and client programs on two different (or even
the same) virtual machines. Use tcpdump to observe the advertised window field.
